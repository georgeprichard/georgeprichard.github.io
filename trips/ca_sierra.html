            <h1>Sierra National Forest, California</h2>
              <p>We pretty much picked this place at random if I recall correctly. It's just south of Yosemite. The advantage of this over Yosemite is that it wasn't on fire, and the drought here wasn't so bad, so there was a bit of water.</p>
              <p>The place we camped at was staggeringly beautiful. A 3 minute walk down to the reservoir, which had cold, clear water perfect for swimming. Nobody else around for a couple of miles, and almost walled by slanted rocks all around the campsite. We were warned to be careful with our food (friendly lady at the nearby store - "there have been a lot of black bears lately...") and then by the camping people to watch out for rattlesnakes. America is much more exciting than Europe.</p>
              <p>These is taken from standing on the huge dam.</p>

              <p>Playing with fire/anime haircut. The firepit was great - adjustable grill on top, perfect for flame grilling dinner.</p>

              <p>The next morning, Berry decided to go for a 20 mile hike by himself because he is insane. He seemed to have fun, this time he at least knew to take water. I lent him my camera, so here are some snaps from that.</p> 
              <p>The start of the trip...</p>

              <p>Florian and I were lazier that day - we drove up to another reservoir that was drained, so we walked along the bed for a few minutes. Then we just swam, and sat around reading waiting for Berry to return.</p>
              <p>As stated, the site was absolutely stunning, so we stayed a second night there - kind of a rarity on the trip. The next morning we drove to <a href="ca_sc.html">Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
